export const DEFAULT_WELCOME_MESSAGE = `Welcome to **PIYESA** (Parts Identification and Yield-based Engine Search Assistant)! 

I'm your intelligent automotive assistant, powered by advanced AI to help you identify car parts and find exactly what you need.

** Featured: Visual Parts Identification**
Just like **Google Lens**, you can upload a photo of any car part, and I'll identify it for you!
1. Click the **+** button next to the chat input
2. Upload a clear photo of the part
3. I'll analyze it, tell you what it is, and where to buy it!

**I can also help you with:**
-  Troubleshooting vehicle issues
-  Comparing prices across Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Lazada, and Shopee
-  Maintenance schedules and "How-to" guides
-  Checking compatibility for your specific vehicle

**To get started, just ask:**
"What is this part?" (with an image)
"I need brake pads for a 2018 Honda Civic"
"Why is my car making a grinding noise?"`;
